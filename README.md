# Research Paper Summarizer

## 📌 Overview

The **Research Paper Summarizer** is a tool designed to automatically generate concise and meaningful summaries of academic research papers. It helps students, researchers, and professionals quickly understand the core contributions and findings of a paper without reading the entire document.

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Transformer-based models** to extract abstracts, key points, and conclusions from research papers (PDF/Text).

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 Upload and process research papers in **PDF** or **text** format.
* 🤖 Use **pre-trained transformer models** (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) for summarization.
* 🔍 Extracts **abstract, key findings, and conclusions** automatically.
* 📊 Provides **short, medium, and detailed summaries**.
* 💡 Useful for **literature reviews, paper screening, and academic research**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
* **Libraries:**

  * `transformers` (Hugging Face)
  * `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` (for PDF parsing)
  * `nltk` / `spacy` (for NLP preprocessing)
  * `torch` / `tensorflow` (depending on model)
